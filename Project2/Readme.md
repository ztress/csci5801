To run this program, open the project in IntelliJ or a similar software. To compile and run, select the run button (green triangle in IntelliJ). A prompt will then be shown in the console. Type "help" for help with running the election, or press any other button to continue. Next the user will be prompted for how many seats the election will fill. Enter an integer for this and press enter. Next, the user will choose the file(s) that store the election ballots. The file selection GUI may appear behind IntelliJ, so look there if you don't see it. After choosing files, the user will choose what type of election to run. Enter "s" for STV and "p" for plurality. Then press enter and the election will begin.
